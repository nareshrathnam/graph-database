What is a Graph Database?  
A graph database (GDB) is a database that uses graph structures for storing data. It uses nodes, edges, and properties instead of tables or documents to represent and store data. The edges represent relationships between the nodes. This helps in retrieving data more easily and, in many cases, with one operation. Graph databases are commonly referred to as a NoSQL.

Why graph database over relational?
The flexibility of a graph database enables the ability to add new nodes and relationships between nodes, making it reliable for real-time data. Relational databases make adding new tables and columns possible while the database is running.1
